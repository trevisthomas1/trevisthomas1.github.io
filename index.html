                         Hey. Thanks for making your way to my website. Glad you’re here. I’m a full-stack developer born and raised in the Silicon
                        Slopes of Utah. I’m married to a Rockstar of a soccer player and HR professional with the cutest husky-doodle you’ve ever
                        met to make up our little family. I’m a big fan of Utah hiking, summer concerts, Friday night movies and binging the best
                        TV shows (you know nothing, Jon Snow). I’m a Utah Jazz season ticket holder and addict. I have a degree in Advertising from
                        BYU but I bleed red and I’m most proud of my the full-stack web development education I received from the U.
                    </p>
                    <p class="copy">
                         I thought my career would take a few different directions before discovering the mind-numbing, gray hair inducing thrill
                        ride that is web development. I’d imagined myself a film director, an account manager at an advertising firm and several
                        other things along the way. Ultimately, though, I found that I loved to create things. I thrive on being able to see immediate
                        results from trying new things, and I treat a google search endeavor like Indian Jones hunting down booby-trapped treasure.
                        The best teammates are teammates, but the second best are my Bose noise reduction headphones and a good film score. Check
                        out my Portfolio to see more of what I’ve done, or jump to Contact so we can connect!
